            <h3> WrestleMania</h3>
            <p> So much happened at Mania, Shisuke had a cool entrace, John fought a returning Undertaker, Asuka's streak was broken by Charolette, and so much more that I don't even know where to start! It was really good with some suprise entrances, I loved every minute of it.</p>
            <h3> NHS Induction</h3>
            <p> When I got inducted is was actually kind of simple, they just called our name and the principle gave us our certifiacte as he shook our hand. I'm still really pround of it, it really is an achievement! Then as we were grabbing refreshments someone came by and recognized Dad and they started talking about how they lived in the same neighboor hood and hunting, and everything. Turns out his freind was Mr.Burnes who's son is a friend of mine in robotics!</p>
            <h3> Tech Fair</h3>
            <p> As you already know, I made second place in regionals and I went on to state. It really was a lot of fun, a long bus ride though. Not only that but in Montgomery I made First Place!! Now I have a nice trophy to show for it.</p>
            <h3> The Flood</h3>
            <p> As you know the downstairs was flooded for a whole week. We had to remove the carpet and get a hotel for a week along with getting a plumber and a whole bunch of issues. Then me and Wyatt had to sleep on the couch because our beds were covered with all our stuff. But, at least you were here to experience it with us.</p>
            <h3> The Champions Breakfast</h3>
            <p> On Friday the 11, I was unexpectedly pulled from class and Mrs.Mintz told me that all of the Tech Fair winners were being pulled and taken to C.E. Hannah for a winners breakfast. When the bus got there me and my friends had soo much fun. We got to walk to the "Walk of Champions" music that the football and wrestling teams walk to on their way to state championship games. That's one experience I'll never forget. Then we had breakfast and got to mingle with the other winners, as well as each high school student was given the chance to share some advice for the younger students that won. It was soo much unforgettable fun!
